# Powerball
This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network implemented with TensorFlow to generate Powerball lottery numbers. The LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that can learn and predict based on long-term dependencies, which theoretically makes it suitable for time series prediction.
